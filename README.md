# Internet-Rokenbok-Controller

Using a stock webcam, Raspberry Pi 4 and Arduino to emulate one of the Rokenbok's controllers and connect it to the internet. Rokenbok is a building system where blue and pink balls are sorted by player controlled vehicles. I used an arduino to emulate the serial connetion between the command deck and the actual remote based on the work of timdv on Instructables.com and and I based a Flask web server around the work of simonvc to control the vehicle as well as see the action based on the work of Miguel Grinberg.


While currently still a work in progress, the whole project will be open sourced here. 

Feel free to make a pull request with improvements!
